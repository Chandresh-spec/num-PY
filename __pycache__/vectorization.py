# # Vectorization means applying operations directly on entire arrays (vectors, matrices, tensors) without using Python for loops.


# NumPy uses optimized C code under the hood, so vectorized operations are much faster than looping in pure Python.

# ðŸ‘‰ In short: one line of NumPy code = hundreds of loop iterations in Python.
