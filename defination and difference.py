# ðŸ‘‰ Definition:
# NumPy is an open-source Python library that provides support for multi-dimensional arrays (ndarrays), 
# along with a collection of mathematical functions to operate on these arrays efficiently. It allows fast 
# computations on large datasets and is widely used in data science, machine learning, artificial intelligence,
#  statistics, and scientific research.


# difference

# List: Can store different data types in the same list (e.g., int, float, string).
# 
# NumPy Array: Stores only one data type (all elements must be same type â†’ int, float, etc.) for efficiency.





# 2. Performance (Speed & Memory)
# 
# List: Slower, takes more memory (because each element is a Python object).
# 
# NumPy Array: Much faster and memory-efficient (data stored in contiguous blocks like C arrays).



import numpy as np
import time

lst = list(range(1000000))
arr = np.array(lst)

# Multiply each element by 2
start = time.time()
lst = [x*2 for x in lst]
print("List time:", time.time()-start)

start = time.time()
arr = arr * 2
print("Array time:", time.time()-start)
